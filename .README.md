# BTC-ARBITRATOR


This project is thought as a way for two parties that have comercial interest with each other to be able to transact even if they don't have 
reputation beetween each other. 

### Idea
The idea of the project at first will be that 2 out 3 multisig that in the case of problem the third key will be held by a a predetermined arbitrator that will help make judgement. 

When judgement is need only two signatures are needed for signing. In the case that neither the buyer or seller accepts judgement(even after renegotiations). 
There could be two ways of handling this: fault back with a timelock to single signature or return the money to everybody.

The basics would be similar to BISQ only using modern things like Taproot to save space. The seller sends the purchasing amount + agreed deposit and the seller also sends and agreed deposit.


#### REQUIREMENT

1. allow for buyer and seller to settle trade. When trade is settled, return the deposit. 
2. if conflic allow for punishing the buyer or seller, with at least the deposit. 
3. Timelock fallback if neither buyer or seller accept the arbitrage judgement.
4. On the last option of all BTC gets returned to the buyer and seller.


#### Future
It would be great to implement FROST in the future this way we could have multiple arbitrator when making a decision. 
This way making it more similar to how and arbitration panel would work in the modern era. 

#### Development 

Running for development should be easy:

```
cargo run 
```

*NOTE: this is a hobby project. I'm trying to do things right but please treat this as such.*
